# ðŸ“‚ Featured Projects:

## ðŸŽ¤ Speech Command Classifier | Python, PyTorch, Librosa

- Collaborated in a team of two to develop a speech recognition model for classifying command audio files.
- Implemented and compared three neural network architectures: 2D CNN, 1D CNN, and a ResNet18-based pre-trained model.
- Preprocessed audio data with resampling, Voice Activity Detection (VAD), padding, and log spectrogram conversion for improved model performance.
- Evaluated models using confusion matrices and loss analysis, optimizing hyperparameters for better accuracy.

## ðŸŽ® Wordle Game | Python, Pygame

- Developed a Wordle-inspired word-guessing game using Python and the Pygame library, replicating the popular word puzzle mechanics.
- Designed a graphical user interface (GUI) using Pygame, including visual feedback for correct, incorrect, and partially correct letters.
- Applied test-driven development (TDD) principles to ensure functionality and maintain clean, maintainable code.

## ðŸ“š Flashcard Web Application | React, Spring, mySQL, Node.js, Docker | Team Project

- Developed a flashcard application utilizing a spaced repetition algorithm to enhance learning efficiency, working collaboratively in a team of four. Designed the app to be user-friendly and intuitive, ensuring a seamless experience for creating, organizing, and reviewing flashcards.
- Implemented features allowing users to create folders, decks, and flashcards, as well as share them with friends for collaborative learning.
- Led the UI/UX development by designing and styling the interface with CSS to provide a clean and accessible user experience. Took responsibility for database structure planning and optimizing SQL queries. Contributed to the React frontend, developing several key pages and ensuring smooth interaction between the user and the application.

## ðŸ“ˆ Quadratic Function Graph Visualization | RISC-V

- Developed a program on the RISC-V architecture to visualize quadratic functions, demonstrating expertise in low-level programming and computer architecture.

## ðŸŒ€ Mandelbrot set vizualization | x86-64, C

- Developed a program to visualize the Mandelbrot set using a combination of C and x86-64 assembly language, optimizing for performance and precision in fractal generation.
- Created a graphical interface for visualizing the Mandelbrot set, allowing for interactive exploration (e.g., zooming and panning) to observe fractal details at different scales.
