# 📂 Featured Projects:

## Wordle Game | Python, Pygame

 - Developed a Wordle-inspired word-guessing game using Python and the Pygame library, replicating the popular word puzzle mechanics.
 - Designed a graphical user interface (GUI) using Pygame, including visual feedback for correct, incorrect, and partially correct letters.
 - Applied test-driven development (TDD) principles to ensure functionality and maintain clean, maintainable code.

## Quadratic Function Graph Visualization | RISC-V

- Developed a program on the RISC-V architecture to visualize quadratic functions, demonstrating expertise in low-level programming and computer architecture.

## Mandelbrot set vizualization | x86-64, C

- Developed a program to visualize the Mandelbrot set using a combination of C and x86-64 assembly language, optimizing for performance and precision in fractal generation.
- Created a graphical interface for visualizing the Mandelbrot set, allowing for interactive exploration (e.g., zooming and panning) to observe fractal details at different scales.
